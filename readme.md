# Full Stack Deep Learning
[Full Stack Deep Learning (FSDL)](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/) is a free public course aimed at teaching people the basics needed to convert their machine learning knowledge to real products. This is not my code but my version of FSDL's repo to play around with and learn on my own. A big thank you to FSDL for making this information freely available!

# About Me
I am a 3rd year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I've decided to complete this course (as well as other public courses [EECS498: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://github.com/bensmidt/EECS-498-DL-Computer-Vision) and [CS229: Machine Learning](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018)) in an effort to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning from a mathematical foundation. 

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Stanford for making these lectures and course material publically available! They are immensely helpful and provide amazing opportunity to learn from many of the best minds in computer science (and other fields). They've been vital in my machine learning journey.
